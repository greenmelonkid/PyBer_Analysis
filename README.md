# PyBer_Analysis


## Resources

Software: Python 3.7.6 and Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of the analysis was to see how  
data differs by city type and how PyBer can use the information to help their company make investment
decisions in the future.

## Results

The following was calculated and has been placed into a dataframe. Based on the ride summary dataframe, you can see 
that although the urban city type has about 13x as many rides as the rural city type, it only makes about 9x the
amount in revenue. While the rural cities make the least amount of revenue for the company, $4328, compared to urban
cities' $39,854, rural cities are still making $10 on average more per ride and the fare per driver is over 3x more 
on average.

A multiple line chart was created to show the average fare by city type over the months of January through April
2019. Through this time period, we can see that the average fare for urban cities is considerably higher every week
than both suburban and rural cities. Looking at the chart, it appears that all city types were lower than average
in April but urban cities was still the highest.

## Summary

After calculating these patterns of different city types, there are a few items that could potentially
address any disparities there are between city types:

	- Urban cities have the most drivers and most amount of rides and therefore total the most revenue per city
type for the company. They have the lowest average fare per driver, possibly because there are so many drivers for
the company to account for. It would be in the company's best interest to continue growing the urban city type by
driver to help maintain or surpass their current revenue for urban cities.
	- Rural cities have the lowest amount of rides, drivers and total fares, yet they have the highest average
fare per driver and highest fare per rider. If there was a way to get more drivers and and advertise to more riders, 
the rural cities could be making more money.
	- Suburban cities have a good average fare per ride and driver and are making just in the middle of the other
two city types. It seems the suburban cities methodology and cost rate is right where it should be.
